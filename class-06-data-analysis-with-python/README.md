# Data Analysis With Python

## Motivation

In this special lecture we analyze 2021-22 Premier League matches using Pandas. We describe the matches in terms of typical golas and goal attempts, we try to find metrics to identify agressively or defensively home and away, and we explore the reationship between these metrics and pre-match betting odds. We merge match data with data on club financials (player enumeration data) to see the relatinship between the financial might of the clubs, their performance, and the odds they get before matches. We create tables and visuals to support our findings.
