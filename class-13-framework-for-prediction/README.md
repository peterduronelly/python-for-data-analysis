# A Framework for Prediction

## Motivation

This lecture serves three goals. First, it refreshes the theory and practice behind building multiple linear regression models; second, it creates a framework for comparing and presenting multiple linear rgression model options which we are experimenting with during our modelling exercise; third, it introduces `cross validation`, a tool for optimizing general model performance.

## This lecture

- EDA and feature-engineering for cross-sectional data
- building multiple linear regression models using the `statmodels` package
- plotting and customizing model result output using the `stargazer` package
- introduction to `cross calidation`, creating train and test data subsets
- presenting key regression fit metrics using Pandas

## Learning outcomes

After successfully completing the learning material, students will be familiar with

- bulding multiple linear regression models on a sequential basis
- presenting regression model key performance metrics
- cross validation, as the primary tool for generalizing and avoiding overfitting
