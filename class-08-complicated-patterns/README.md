# Complicated Patterns

## Motivation

This lecture show tools and techniques to handle mostly non-linear complicated patterns in data. While linear regression model is simple to run and straghtfowrd to interpret, relationship between data is rarely linear. Handling non-linearity is a usual part of the model-building process. 

## This lecture

- transform variables to create linear relationships between non-linear variables
- interpreting regression results with non-linear relationships
- visualizing non-linear relationships in the transformed and the original data space
- creating user-defined functions to help with data complex transformations
- tweaking and customizing `seaborn` graphs

## Learning outcomes

After successfully completing the learning material, students will be familiar with

- building regressions where underlying data follows complicated patterns
- creating visualizations with insight into the nature of these complicated relationships
