# Time Series Regressions

## Motivation

This is a complicated lecture which can easily overwhelm the novice data analyst or scientist. Time series data presents additional opportunities as well as additional challenges for regression analysis. Unlike cross-sectional data, it enables examining how $y$ changes when $x$ changes, and it also allows us to examine what happens to $y$ right away or with a delay. However, variables in time series data come with some special features that affect how we should estimate regressions, and how we can interpret their coefficients. The number and depth of the new concepts will likely make this class more challenging than the previous ones. 

## This lecture

- manipulating time series data for getting deeper insight and for building better-performing models
- methods and workflows for testing stationarity and unit-root: Augmented Dickey-Fuller and Phillips-Perron tests
- visualizing the results of the stationarity tests
- volatility-clustering, plotting and interpreting the market beta
- visualizing market and equity risk profiles
- handling seasonality ith seasonal variables
- cumulative/long-run associations

## Learning outcomes

After successfully completing the learning material, students will be familiar with

- the basic intricacies of time series modelling
- preparing data for modelling time series relationships
- calculating and interpreting stationarity tests
- visualizing and handling the effects of seasonal factors to the dependent variable
