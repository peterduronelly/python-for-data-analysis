# PLotting

## Motivation

Plotting is the primary tool for data exploration and for presenting results of analytics. In this lecture we cover the `matplotlib` package and Pandas `plot` method.

There are multiple plotting packages but we focus on `matplotlib`. It is a massive library, which offers so much, that it can easily become overwhelming. Creating a basic chart is fairly simple, but sometimes just a little customization already requires a deep dive into the API.

One of the reasons we cover matplotlib here though is that many other libraries are also built on the matplotlib API, and plotting charts directly from Pandas dataframes is easier if we have a basic understading of matplotlib's mechanics. There are other popular charting packages, such as `seaborn` and `Plotly`, but we think that a real Pythonista should be able to work with matplotlib objects.

We will create charts with `seaborn` in later classes.
