# Pandas

## Motivation

This lecture is about the most important tool for a data analyst or data scientist: the `Pandas` module. Pandas `dataframes` are your tool for working with tabular data. Take it as a programmable version of an Excel sheet. The problem with Excel is that it is too good so it is difficult to motivate users to try something new. Despite its flexibility and user-friendly interface Excel does have limitations, which Pandas can solve.

Pandas started out as the Python version of R dataframes. Now it has its own ecosystem.

Pandas is not suitable for processing '*big data*' but it's way of working serves as a basis for big data tools like *Spark* dataframes.
