# User-defined Functions, Classes, Numpy

## Motivation

This lecture's most important parts are user-defined functions and `numpy`. In addition, it talks about classes and `object-oriented programming` (OOP). OOP is an advanced concept at this early point but it is useful to get familiar with the basics. OOP, however, is not necessary to carry out basic analytical tasks using Python.

## This lecture

- user-defined functions
- default values, type hints and return values
- what is OOP
- classes, attributes, methods
- pubic and private variables
- numpy basics
- selecting data using masking
- high-performance calculations using numpy
- matrix algebra
- vectorized functions
- extra: regex + processing logs with Python

## Learning outcomes

After successfully completing the learning material, students will be familiar with

- how to define reusable functions
- OOP main conepts
- how to create classes and how to instantiate objects from that class
- how t ocompare ojbects of the same class
- how to control for class attributes
- numpy basics
- processing data using numpy
- calculating statistics using numpy
- linear algebra with numpy 
- processing semi-structured text data

## Note

Some of the cells will throw an error. This is part of the material to make the reader see what works and what does not.
