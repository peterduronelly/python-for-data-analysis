# Generalizing Regression Result

## Motivation

This lecture shows a workflow for inspecting complicated relationships between data and the step-by-step process of building various models to find the best-fitting solution. We compare different regression models, check their external validity, and organize our faindings into neatly formatted output tables and graphs.

## This lecture

- feature engineering
- testing various regression model assumptions
- accessing the key metrics from our regression results
- using the `stargazer` package to create customized reports on our regression results
- plotting confidence and prediciton intervals using `matplotlib`

## Learning outcomes

After successfully completing the learning material, students will be familiar with

- a workflow for running many regressions to describe the many potential relationship between variables
- visualizing and comparing the results of these optional regression models
- running external validity checks
