# Class 01. Coding Basics

## Motivation
In this lecture we jump into the very basics of Python. This is the beginning of a long journey, which, honestly, will never end.

## This lecture
- working with Jupyter notebooks
- variables: types and assignment
- operators
- basic data structures: lists, tuples, dictionaries and sets
- introducing json
- working with modules - built-in and user-defined
- conditional statements and control flows

## Learning outcomes
After successfully completing the learning material, students will be familiar with
- general coding principles (for both Python and other languages)
- basic variable types of integers, gloats and booleans
- how to assign value to a variable
- how to do basic operations with these variables
- how to manipulate strings, focusing on writing some simple SQL - queries, the primary tool of any data professional.
