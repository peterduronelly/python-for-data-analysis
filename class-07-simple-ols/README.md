# Simple Linear Regression

## Motivation

We introduce `simple linear regressions` where a dependent variable is explained by a single independent variable. We do explanatory data analysis (EDA) using plots and data aggregation. At the end of the lecture we revive the Premier League season data from Class 6 and run a regression where we try to explain the relationship between home and away team odds and player enumeration. 

## This lecture

- plotting regression variables using Pandas plot and the `seaborn` library
- data aggregation using Pandas `groupby`
- running and plotting lowess regressions
- running regressions using the `statsmodels` package
- displaying and interpreting regression outputs

## Learning outcomes

After successfully completing the learning material, students will be familiar with

- how to carry out explanatory data analysis
- how to build regressions with the `statsmodels` package
- how to visualize regression results
